## Authorization and Authentication with Devise

  We chose to implement user authorization and authentication with [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise). Devise is a powerful library that is well supported and the most popular of authentication libraries.

  The team was familiar with hand-rolling auth this which is best practice for a developer new Rails to gain understanding of what is happening behind the scenes when using a time saving library like devise.

  So far we are happy with this choice and will need to learn more as we implement omniauth via google and customize the defaults that devise delivers.

## Page Object Models

  For the purpose of organization and encapsulation we used Page Object Models to streamline integration testing. A Page Object) is basically a PORO(plain old ruby object) used with capybara for test setup to accomplish tasks like creating a user, logging in a user, and visiting the user's dashboard. This is a sequence of events will be visited repeatedly in our test suite.

  __Page Object Example:__

  ```
  module Pages

  class LoginPage < Page

    def visit_page
      visit '/'
      click_on 'Login'
      self
    end

    def login(user, password)
      fill_in 'Email', with: user.email
      fill_in 'Password', with: password
      click_on 'Log in'
    end
  end
end
```
